  # The default method is to use a DBM backed cache.  It's not super fast, but
  # it's portable and doesn't require another server to be running like
  # memcached
  #GnuTLSCache dbm /var/cache/apache2/gnutls_cache

  # mod_gnutls can optionaly use a memcached server to store SSL sessions.
  # This is useful in a cluster environment, where you want all your servers to
  # share a single SSL session cache
  #GnuTLSCache memcache "127.0.0.1 server2.example.com server3.example.com"
